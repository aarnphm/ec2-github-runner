# ec2-github-runner
A fork of https://github.com/machulav/ec2-github-runner but with `--unattended` and multiple subnets support.

Possibly a bug upstream, but I cannot figure out why my runners keep failing. So I create this fork for the action to start the runner with `--unattended`.

I will one day submit a PR upstream. Refer to the original repo for instructions.
